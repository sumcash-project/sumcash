Sumcoin 0.11.4 BETA

Setup
---------------------
Sumcoin is the original Sumcoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of Sumcoin transactions (which is currently less than one gigabyte); depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download Sumcoin, visit [sumcoin.org](https://sumcoin.org/download).

Running
---------------------
The following are some helpful notes on how to run Sumcoin on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:

- `bin/sumcoin-qt` (GUI) or
- `bin/sumcoind` (headless)

### Windows

Unpack the files into a directory, and then run sumcoin-qt.exe.

### macOS

Drag Sumcoin to your applications folder, and then run Sumcoin.
